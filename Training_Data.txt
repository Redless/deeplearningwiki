====== Training Data ======

See also: [[Testing Data]], [[Validation Data]]

Training data is a set of inputs and outputs that a neural network is trained on. The neural network will learn to approximate some function that takes the inputs and produces the outputs.

Training data can also be "unlabelled" and smuggled in using a technique such as [[GAN's]].
