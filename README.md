This is a wiki about neural networks and deep learning, maintained by me, Gabriel Brookman, for personal use. When I've tried to learn a lot about a single topic in the past, I've found wikis to be the best format, but since there was no wiki on the topic, I've created one instead, and am recording what I've learned from reading a bunch of papers.

The wiki is written with and can be viewed with zim. If you want to contribute you can message me at lastnamefirstname at gmail dot com.
