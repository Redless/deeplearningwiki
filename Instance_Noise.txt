====== Instance Noise ======

Instance noise is a trick for stabilizing [[GANs|GAN]] training: https://www.inference.vc/instance-noise-a-trick-for-stabilising-gan-training/

Before the [[Discriminator]] is trained on a given sample, gaussian white noise is added to the input data.

This is a method of making the discriminator's job harder, which alleviates the vanishing gradient problem.
