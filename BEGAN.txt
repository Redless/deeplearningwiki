====== BEGAN ======

BEGAN is a [[GANs|GAN]] architecture. From [[Google Brain]]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10717.pdf.

It has an autoencoder [[Discriminator|discriminator]] that encodes stuff. Then, it tries to make its auto-encodings as close together as possible. Without using any other [[GAN Training Techs|GAN tricks,]] they got very good results. I still don't understand it very well.
