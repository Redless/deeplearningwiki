====== Learning Rate ======

The learning rate is the hyperparameter that determines how quickly the [[Gradient Descent]] proceeds during training. It's the most import [[Hyperparameter]] for quickly getting results, so tuning it or performing [[Hyperparameter Optimization]] is very important in the case of the learning rate particularly.

There are several approaches for adjusting learning rate during training:

* [[Cyclic Learning Rate]]
