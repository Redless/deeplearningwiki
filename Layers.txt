====== Layers ======

There are many different types of layers, and each one takes inputs and provides outputs. Putting many layers together results in a model. Here are some examples of layers:

* [[Fully Connected Layer]]
* [[Convolutional Layer]]
* [[Dropout]]
* [[Reshape Layer]]

Layers usually are only connected to the layers immediately before and after them, but in some architectures, such as [[DenseNet]] and [[U-Net]], layers are connected to different ones.
