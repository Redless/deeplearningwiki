====== Recurrent Neural Networks ======

Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural networks that applies to sequential data. For each element in the sequence, a node:
* takes that element in as input
* takes in a certain, specific "holdover" as input from the previous node
* returns an output for that element
* passes its own "holdover" to the next node in the sequence

Because of how they work for sequential data, these networks are much-used to process music and other auditory data.

Their weakness is their inhability to incorporate data from many items earlier in the sequence. This problem was fixed by [[LSTM's]].
