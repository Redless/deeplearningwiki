====== Neural Networks ======

Artificial neural networks are a family of machine learning algorithms based on the function of the brain. They consist of [[Layers]] of [[Nodes]] linked together by weighted connections, and can learn (in theory) to approximate any function if they are given enough examples of the function performed correctly, in the form of [[Training Data]] and a [[Loss Function]]. They do this by iteratively tuning their parameters through [[Gradient Descent]].

They have many variations, including (most promisingly) [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] and [[Recurrent Neural Networks]]. These variations have eclipsed so-called "vanilla" neural networks, although [[Self-Normalizing Neural Networks]] may change this.

They are typically constructed using software such as [[Keras]] or [[Tensorflow]].
