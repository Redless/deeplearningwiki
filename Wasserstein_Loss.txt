====== Wasserstein Loss ======

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf

This paper from [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|NYU]] and [[Facebook AI Research|FAIR]] presents the Wasserstein GAN.

"Earth Mover Distance" is always differentiable and offers good gradients. To change the GAN to be equivalent to earth mover distance:

* The discriminator should ouput as large as possible numbers for real results, and as small as possible numbers of false results.
* Clip the weights of the gradient after each iteration
* Train the discriminator to convergence before you even start the generator (not sure how this is possible with the first thing, but w/e

The Wasserstein Loss function is commonly used in [[GANs]], and prevents several of their flaws.
