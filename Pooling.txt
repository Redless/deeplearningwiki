====== Pooling ======

Pooling is a process by which vectors are [[Downsampling|Downsampled]] in [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]. There are several types of pooling, but all have in common that they take an AxBxCx....Z tensor as input, apply a function to it, and produce a scalar output. Several common types of pooling are:

* [[Max Pooling]]
* [[Average Pooling]]

In addition, [[Atrous Pooling]] changes the locations where the elements in the pool are sampled from.

Towards the edges of the input, the type of [[Padding]] effects how exactly the pooling works.
