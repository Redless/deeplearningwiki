====== Loss Function ======

Loss functions are the functions that we try to minimize through [[Gradient Descent]]. There are many loss functions, each takes a "target" and an "attempt" and returns a metric of how close the target and attempt are to one another. Here are a few examples:

* [[Binary Crossentropy]]
* [[Wasserstein Loss]]

[[GANs]] allow a second neural network (the [[Discriminator]]) to be trained to approximate the loss function for a first neural network (the [[Generator]]), circumventing the need for a traditional loss.
