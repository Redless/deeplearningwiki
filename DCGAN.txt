Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks constitute a specific set of architecture constraints for a [[GANs|GAN]] involving [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]. It is extremely effective.

It leverages:

* [[All-Convolutional Networks]], which perform [[Downsampling]] using [[Strided Convolutions]] instead of a traditional, deterministic [[Pooling]] algorithm.
* [[Fully Convolutional Networks]], which have no [[Fully Connected Layer|fully connected layers]], preferring instead to use [[Convolutional Layer|Convolutional Layers]] for every layer of the network
* [[Batch Normalization]], which normalizes the input to each unit to have 0 mean and unit variance. Batchnorm was applied to all layers except generator output and discriminator input (?).

The guidelines that the paper puts forth are:

* Replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided
convolutions (generator).
* Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator.
* Remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.
* Use ReLU activation in generator for all layers except for the output, which uses Tanh.
* Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers.
